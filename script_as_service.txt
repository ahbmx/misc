Creating a Linux Service Script with Network Dependency
To create a script that runs as a service, enables on boot, and waits for network availability, follow these steps:

Method 1: Using systemd (Recommended for modern Linux distributions)
Create your service script (e.g., /usr/local/bin/my_service.sh):

bash
#!/bin/bash

# Wait for network connectivity
while ! ping -c 1 -W 1 8.8.8.8 >/dev/null 2>&1; do
    echo "Waiting for network..."
    sleep 1
done

# Your main service commands here
echo "Network available, starting service..."
# Add your service commands below
Make it executable:

bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/my_service.sh
Create a systemd service file (/etc/systemd/system/my_service.service):

ini
[Unit]
Description=My Custom Service
After=network.target network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/my_service.sh
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Enable and start the service:

bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable my_service.service
sudo systemctl start my_service.service
Method 2: Using init.d (For older systems)
Create your init script (/etc/init.d/my_service):

bash
#!/bin/bash
# chkconfig: 2345 99 01
# description: My Custom Service

case "$1" in
    start)
        # Wait for network
        while ! ping -c 1 -W 1 8.8.8.8 >/dev/null 2>&1; do
            echo "Waiting for network..."
            sleep 1
        done
        
        echo "Starting my service..."
        # Add your startup commands here
        ;;
    stop)
        echo "Stopping my service..."
        # Add your shutdown commands here
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop}"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

exit 0
Make it executable:

bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/my_service
Enable the service:

bash
sudo update-rc.d my_service defaults  # On Debian/Ubuntu
# OR
sudo chkconfig my_service on          # On RHEL/CentOS
Start the service:

bash
sudo service my_service start
Notes:
The ping test to 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) checks for internet connectivity. You may want to replace this with a local gateway or specific host if you only need local network.

For systemd services, network-online.target is the proper way to wait for network, but the ping check adds an extra layer of verification.

Consider adding proper error handling and logging to your script for production use.
